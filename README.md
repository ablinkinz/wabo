WABO is a tool designed to be a starting point for creating complex orchestrations
that are based on weather alerts. I started this project as a POC for my home lab.
The idea was to move my workload to the cloud when there are hurricane alerts in my area.

As time goes on I will add some orchestration examples and some location self awareness logic.
